In the following exercise we were required to write a program to find the prime factors composing
numbers. RSA encryption uses the reverse principle to generate very big numbers that are impossible
to factor on today's computers.

The program IntegerFactorization uses the GField and GFNumber classes to achieve this feat.

In the RhoPollard algorithm implementation, I chose to resolve the issue of non prime return values
by calling the brute force algorithm on the return value, rather than calling RhoPollard recursively
on it. This is since it seemed more efficient since if a the number is non prime I noticed it would
usually be very small.
